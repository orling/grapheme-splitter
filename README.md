# Background

In JavaScript there is not always a one-to-one relationship between string characters and what a user would call a separate visual "letter". Some symbols are represented by several characters. This can cause issues when splitting strings and inadvertently cutting a multi-char letter in half, or when you need the actual number of letters in a string.

For example, emoji characters like "🌷","🎁","💩","😜" and "👍" are represented by two JavaScript characters each (high surrogate and low surrogate). That is, 

    "🌷".length == 2

What's more, some languages often include combining marks - characters that are used to modify the letters before them. Common examples are the German letter ü and the Spanish letter ñ. Sometimes they can be represented alternatively both as a single character and as a letter + combining mark, with both forms equally valid:
    
    var two = "ñ";//unnormalized two-char n+◌̃  , i.e. "\u006E\u0303";
    var one = "ñ";//normalized single-char, i.e. "\u00F1"
    console.log(one==two);//prints 'false'

Unicode normalization, as performed by the popular punycode.js library or ECMAScript 6's String.normalize, can **sometimes** fix those differences and turn two-char sequences into single characters. But it is **not** enough in all cases. Some languages like Hindi make extensive use of combining marks on their letters, that have no dedicated single-codepoint Unicode sequences, due to the sheer number of possible combinations.
For example, the Hindi word "अनुच्छेद" is comprised of 5 letters and 3 combining marks:

अ + न + ु + च + ् + छ + े + द

which is in fact just 5 user-perceived letters:

अ + नु + च् + छे + द

and which Unicode normalization would not combine properly.
There are also the unusual letter+combining mark combinations which have no dedicated Unicode codepoint. The string Z͑ͫ̓ͪ̂ͫ̽͏̴̙̤̞͉͚̯̞̠͍A̴̵̜̰͔ͫ͗͢L̠ͨͧͩ͘G̴̻͈͍͔̹̑͗̎̅͛́Ǫ̵̹̻̝̳͂̌̌͘!͖̬̰̙̗̿̋ͥͥ̂ͣ̐́́͜͞ obviously has 5 separate letters, but is in fact comprised of 75 JavaScript characters, most of which are combining marks.

Enter the grapheme-splitter.js library. It can be used to properly split JavaScript strings into what a human user would call separate letters (or "extended grapheme clusters" in Unicode terminology), no matter what their internal representation is. It is an implementation of the Unicode UAX-29 standard. 

# Installation

Just include the grapheme-splitter.js file, for example like this:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="grapheme-splitter.js"></script>

# Usage

Just initialize and use:

    var splitter = new GraphemeSplitter();
    
    //split the string to an array of grapheme clusters (one string each)
    var graphemes = splitter.splitGraphemes(string);
	
    //or do this if you just need their number
    var graphemeCount = splitter.countGraphemes(string);

This library is heavily influenced by Devon Govett's excellent grapheme-breaker CoffeeScript library at https://github.com/devongovett/grapheme-breaker with an emphasis on ease of integration and pure JavaScript implementation.
